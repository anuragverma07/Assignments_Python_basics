        "1.What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and versatility. It is popular due to its vast libraries, community support, and use in web development, data science, AI, and automation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The interpreter is a program that executes Python code line by line, converting it into machine-readable instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Pre-defined keywords are reserved words in Python (e.g., if, else, for, while, def) that have specific meanings and cannot be used as variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "No, Python keywords cannot be used as variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Mutability refers to whether an objectâ€™s value can be changed after creation. Mutable objects can change, while immutable objects cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists allow modifications (adding, removing, updating elements), while tuples do not, ensuring data integrity and performance optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is the difference between == and is operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "== checks for value equality, while is checks for object identity (whether they refer to the same memory location).\n",
        "\n",
        "8.What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Logical operators (and, or, not) combine multiple conditions in boolean expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Type casting converts one data type into another (e.g., int(\"10\") converts a string to an integer).\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "Implicit casting is done automatically by Python (e.g., int to float). Explicit casting is done manually using functions like int(), float(), str().\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Conditional statements (if, elif, else) control the flow of execution based on conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        "elif (short for \"else if\") allows multiple conditions to be checked sequentially after an if statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "for loops iterate over a sequence (list, range, etc.), while while loops run as long as a condition remains true.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "A while loop is better when the number of iterations is unknown, such as waiting for user input or running a program until a specific condition is met."
